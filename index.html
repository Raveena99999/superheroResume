          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Radha-Krishna is the combined form of the Hindu god Krishna with his
            consort Radha. They are regarded as the feminine as well as the
            masculine realities of God, in several Krishnaite traditions of
            Vaishnavism.
          </p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            It is believed that Krishna enchants the world, but Radha enchants
            even him. Therefore, she is the supreme goddess of all, and together
            they are called Radha-Krishna. In many Vaishnava sections, Radha
            Krishna are often identified as the avatars of Lakshmi Narayan.
